## Tips for writing papers with Jimmy
-----------------------------------
1. Begin by adding the template and build it up incrementally. Checking in a template 
inspires to work more towards the paper.
2. Experimental results are the most important. Start with the experimental section first.
3. Add the necessary figures/tables etc., and elaborate them in your write-up.
4. Jimmy will then have a look at them and will help you to express your ideas better.
5. Always generate your graphs in *.svg format with a high dpi value. 
6. While writing, use frequent line breaks since Jimmy uses emacs to have a look at your 
draft and he would have to scroll back and forth otherwise. This also helps you compare
your draft before and after Jimmy has had a look at it.
7. If there are details that you would want to add to your draft but are not sure at the 
time of writing, use the following legends to remind you of to-dos
\newcommand{\blue}[1]{\textcolor{blue}{#1}}
\newcommand{\red}[1]{\textcolor{red}{#1}}

Use \blue{} to remind yourself of the changes that you would have to make
Jimmy will use \red{} to notify you if he wants you to add anything to the paper
